### A little about me
Hi, my name is Bosco. Originally from Hong Kong, I'm now a student at the British Columbia Institute of Technology, BC, Canada. I am an aspiring, self-motivated software developer who has a strong interest in building scalable software that has positive impact on society and the environment. I like studying mathematics and data structures because they allow us to conceptualize problems in ways that make solving them funner and easier.

### What I'm currently working on
* 2023 new grad job hunt
* AWS Solution Architect Associate
